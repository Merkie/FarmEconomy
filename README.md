# FarmEconomy

FarmEconomy is a Minecraft plugin (Spigot/PaperMC 1.20.X) that seeks to add a rich economy via incentivizing farming in a survival-like experience.

### Features:
- Basic Economy Commands
  - /bal, /sellall
- Organic / Non-Organic Produce
  - Crops broken directly by a player will have the item lore "Organic Produce"
  - Organic produce will sell for more money than regular crops not harvested by hand
  - This is essentially a nerf to automatic farms
 
### Coming Soon:
- Fluctuating crop prices
- GUI for selling crops (/sell)
- GUI for viewing crop prices (/prices)
- 3rd party economy plugin integration
